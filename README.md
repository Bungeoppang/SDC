# FEC - Front End Capstone

## Authors
Made with love by Pascal Bui, Minggui Yactayo, and Raymond Yee

## Overview

This Front-End Capstone project was made during the senior phase of the Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive (RFP2202).
The objective of this project was to build a fully functioning retail application catering to client specifications.
Each team member built key components (Overview, Questions & Answers, Ratings & Reviews) in a single code base to produce a featurefull, polished, and deployed application.

Like a good home-made sourdough, this project was built from scratch. With the objective in mind and maintaining learning as a priority, the team decided to take on the challenge of a non-UI based project and strengthen essential front-end concepts. Rather than using frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI to facilitate the styling of the application, the team instrumented styled-components and raw CSS to implement the uniformity, theme, and design of the application.

## Description

In it's essence, this application mirrors that of a retail page. When a user browses a desired product, the information displayed on the page will ultimately decide whether the user will buy a product or not. This application encapsulates the information the user needs in order to make an informed decision in three main components: Overview, Answers & Questions, and Ratings & Reviews.
In the Overview component...
Futhermore, in the Answers & Questions...
Lastly, in Ratings & Reviews...
